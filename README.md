# PH_Fixes

Error/Bug/Lag fixes for various existing plugins, the game itself.  

**Installation:**  
1. Drop `PH_Fixes.dll` into `Plugins/`  
2. Drop `PH_Fixes_PLUGINNAME.dll` into `Plugins/PH_Fixes/`  

**Updating**  
Overwrite the already existing files, remove any if stated in the update notes.  

**Compatibility**  
If you don't have a plugin installed for which there is a fix, that fix .dll will get skipped and will not create errors.  

**Available Fixes**  
1. DemonFusion  
* Fixes an error on scene change.  
2. Main game  
* Much faster time from starting the .exe to the title scene.  
3. HoneyPot  
* Fixed the 'stutter lag' on scene change when in the menu.  
* Fixed some random errors.  
4. HooahHome  
* Fixed random error on shutdown.  
5. ProjectHighHeel  
* Fixed a spamming error. **NOTES: 2**  

**Notes**  
1. Test period:  
* Currently this plugin is in its test period, that means there might be issues, which I need you to report if you get them. Make an issue here or contact me on discord 2155X#2917.  
2. ProjectHighHeel:  
* The current 'errorfix' is disabling the execution of locking the camera in place when in the PHH UI. If you drag the window, the camera view will move as well. This is only a temporary workaround which I will improve later.  

**To-do**  
1. Make the code cleaner.  
2. ....
